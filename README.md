To begin with, one main change I did to Yewchaat was the login page. I decided that I wanted to make the login page more appealing to the eyes hance why I decided
to add a blue gradient to the background. On top of that, I wanted to implement cards to my design hence why I opted to essentially redo the whole layout for the username
and login button. Though it cannot be seen, I also added a minor animation when hovering over the card itself, jsut to make it more interesting. For the chat page itself,
I did not implement too much on it, I simply changed the color of the navbar at the top of the screen to match the blue theme more. Additionally, I also made it so that the color
of the usernames are also light blue. Finally, another small edition I made was that if you hover over the users, the card will darken.
